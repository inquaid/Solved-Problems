Aero-Sense: The project aims to design and implement a microcontroller-based air quality monitoring system that measures and reports the purity of the surrounding air in real time. Utilizing a microcontroller, the system integrates several affordable yet reliable sensors: the PMS5003 for detecting particulate matter (PM2.5), the MH-Z19B for measuring carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration, the SGP30 for monitoring volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the DHT22 for recording temperature and humidity. Data collected by these sensors is processed and displayed into mobile phone, with the option to transmit readings wirelessly for remote monitoring and data analysis. The system provides a comprehensive, low-cost solution for assessing air quality, making it valuable for educational, research, and public awareness purposes. By making air pollution indicators accessible and understandable, this project empowers users to make informed decisions about their environment. Ultimate goal is to integrate IC's into mobile phone so that we can have the AQI built-in into mobile phones.
